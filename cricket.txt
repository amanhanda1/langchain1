With a history that dates back to the 16th century, cricket has evolved into a global sport watched and loved by billions. What makes cricket so captivating is the combination of explosive batting, lethal bowling, nail-biting finishes, and legendary players who become household names.

Let’s dive into some fascinating facts, legendary cricketers, top records, and iconic trophies that have shaped the history of the sport.
